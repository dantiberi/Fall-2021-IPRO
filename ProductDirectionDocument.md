## Problem Statment - Old
1. Middle school students lack a strong foundational understanding of algebra because current edutainment solutions fail to make it engaging for visual and interactive learners.
2. In the vital subject of middle school algebra, teachers struggle to find edutainment solutions that address the needs of visual learners who currently struggle to learn the subject through traditional methods.

## Problem Statment - New
1. Middle school through high school students lack a strong foundational understanding of core mathematic concepts such as algebra and early calculus. 
2. Current edutainment solutions fail to make it engaging for visual and interactive learners which leaves educators without the necessary tools.

## Top Two to Three Scenarios
### Scenario #1
Matthew L. Jebra is a math teacher who notices that his students are falling behind in algebra and aren’t engaging with the material. As a tech-savvy teacher, he sees this as an opportunity to find a unique and tech-based solution for this problem. He finds a service that will allow students to participate in real time from their own devices, and simply creates an account to set up a group session. With a quick search through the pre-existing material, Matthew selects the topic his students are struggling with and starts the game. Now all he needs to do is display the join code and allow his students to enter the code on their devices. Afterwards, he can see which class of problems his students need to improve on and have already mastered.
### Scenario #2
Jimmy just doesn’t understand algebra. He has difficulty comprehending the notation and the steps involved in solving equations, and he is too shy to ask questions. One day his teacher announces that instead of a normal lesson, they will be playing a game together as a class. Jimmy’s teacher displays a code on the board and asks the students to enter the code on the game’s website from their phone or school computers. Jimmy enters the code and joins the game. He and the other students solve algebra problems step-by-step to win the game with his classmates. The next day, the teacher goes over the concepts Jimmy struggled with on the whiteboard, and the next time Jimmy plays the game with his classmates, he feels more confident in his skills.
### Scenario #3
Sarah is a middle school algebra teacher who likes to make classes fun and engaging for her students. She has noticed over the last few years that her English and History teacher colleagues have been integrating student’s personal devices into fun games that help students learn about the material. However, when she tries using these same apps for math, her students complain that it just feels like another quiz instead of a game. This time Sarah uses a new app that creates a campaign for the whole class to participate in real-time while also providing much more intuitive options for solving problems step-by-step. After class, she can view how students performed across the different sections and prepare a different campaign for next time.
