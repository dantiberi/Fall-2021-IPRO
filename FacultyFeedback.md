# Faculty Feedback -Randy Guthrie #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).

- SCRUM Lead (Andrew)
- I like that you are doing retros; what are your thoughts?
- [Suggestion] board hygiene: keep board updated even during the week. Do you need to have a mid-week sync?
- [Suggestion] Add labels to stories to show which Sprint/Week they were assigned to, in order to know if stories are taking too long to close
- [Suggestion] Everyone on the team should be writing / editing stories, and committing changes/pull requests. If you don't know how, then have someone help but everyone should be doing the basics

## Week 11 ##

 - Reminder: Dry Run Nov 16; Final Presentation Nov 30th.  Template in Blackboard Content
 - I liked that you are doing Retros and they seem meaningful; keep it up!
