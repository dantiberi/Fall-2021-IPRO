# Faculty Feedback -Randy Guthrie #

## Grading Philosophy ##
- Team grade - You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your team performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).
- Individual grade - your attendance (see syllabus) and contributions to the team are key factors in your grade.  You start with an A and we will give you feedback if your performance is falling below the A pace (e.g., your A is at risk).

## Week 10 ##
- SCRUM Lead (Andrew)
- I like that you are doing retros; what are your thoughts?
- Comment: I think retros help us a lot in understanding what each member is thinking. It also helps us to improve the team performance since each one can point out what the team need to improve and what he are struggling with.
- [Suggestion] board hygiene: keep board updated even during the week. Do you need to have a mid-week sync?
- Comment: We usually keep each other up-to-date through discord during the week. 
- [Suggestion] Add labels to stories to show which Sprint/Week they were assigned to, in order to know if stories are taking too long to close
- Comment: Yes, we will be doing that.
- [Suggestion] Everyone on the team should be writing / editing stories, and committing changes/pull requests. If you don't know how, then have someone help but everyone should be doing the basics
- Comment: During our meeting, we have discussed about this problem and everyone now has known how to do the basics.

 - I liked that you are doing Retros and they seem meaningful; keep it up!
 - I liked that you were able to meet face to face and got a lot done "in person"
